# 3D Hyper N-back
- Fixed stats reset
- Improved accuracy criteria
- Added individual stimuli accuracy metrics
- Randomized stimuli game mode
- Adaptive N algorithm: Ratcheting adaptive algorithm that simultaneously reduces difficulty of your next n-level while increasing difficulty of your current n-level
- Adaptive D algorithm (progressive stimuli count): Ratcheting adaptive algorithm that simultaneously reduces difficulty of your next additional stimuli while increasing difficulty of your current number of stimuli

# Bug/to-do list
- Current adaptive algorithm level on settings page not immediately updating
- End game dialog n-level is higher than it should be
- adaptive algorithm breaks when advancing too quickly
